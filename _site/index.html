        <div class="large text-muted"><p> Gender disparities have long existed in film industry since its naissance. As something that reaches so many people in the world, movie is bound to influence our society. With the subject being hotter than ever, the question of female representation in the movie industry arises.
We want to analyse gender equality not because it is a buzzword or a trendy topic. We believe that on and off-screen representation has an impact on how we see ourselves and others. Underrepresentation can contribute to negative stereotypes and biases. It could also mislead the public that men are more valuable and superior, which has serious consequences for women's careers and opportunities.
<p>In this project, we aim to analyse the on and off-screen gender representation in movie industry to  address the gender disparities problem. This is done by comparing data among different genres, geographical areas and time series, plus making prediction and analysing possible stereotypes.</p>

      <p>Feminist film critic Laura Mulvey believes that, movie production is in control of men who make decisions that appeal to their own values and interests.
        She describes a term called <font size="4"><b> 'the male gaze' </b></font> where female characters are often depicted as attractive rather than having complex characteristics and directs the root of the problem to men being dominant in behind-scene roles. To see if this is true, we also look at female situations in writers and directors.

        <p>Things go even worse for female directors and writers. The overall growth rate of female employment in film industry is much lower than worldwide female employment rate.
          A 2-degree least square model also implies that, in year 2127, female writer ratio will be equivalent to male. Meanwhile for directors, it's in year 2133.</p>
          <p>In those less-exposed and darker corners, inequal competition is way more brutal. While fewer female voices and perspectives might lead to a more stereotyped portrayal of

          <p>There are some movie genres solely occupied by male directors and writers. Those are more about themselves, about their adventures, dreams. Some male dominant genres
             such as action have been long criticized for objectifying women.
            While for female directors and writers, genres seem to be unavoidably limited to painful and emotional female roles, as a mother, a lover or a sentimental woman. 
            <p>It's not only a reflection of female behind-scene situation, but also a mirror showing what women have experienced in real world. Women's pain is built-in.
              Before pursuit of self-fulfillment, women have to deal with what society has imposed on them - a curse of inborn duty. And their real needs as independent human beings 
              are somehow always neglected.
            <p>Female directors and writers might be more aware of this problem. With an improvement of gender representation off-screen, "male gaze" might be avoided in movie story-telling.  </p>

          How are female and male characters portrayed? In particular, are females portrayed more positively or more negatively than males? The most commonly

            <p>Those wordclouds give us a good idea of adjectives used to describe each gender. Words describing female are more romantic, fictional and superficial than those for male. But it is still quite vague to fully answer the question.
              To further analyse it, a sentiment score is assigned to every adjective on a scale from -1 to 1.

This is in contrast to male characters, who may not be emphased much on appearance.

                  Feminism movements for various female rights arose in the world, such as civil rights and equal pay.
                  However, progress in movie industry was rather slow. Technological development seemed to be the focus. 
                  First color 3D film was born.

                    Film industry was booming. With more and more feminism movements, female representation
                  in film was largely improved. It's glad to see 'mee too' movement in movie industry.
                  But it's still not sufficient.

      The Bechdel Test, or Bechdel-Wallace Test, sometimes called the Mo Movie Measure or Bechdel Rule is a simple test 
      which names the following three criteria:</br> 
      (1) It has to have at least two women in it. </br>
      (2) They talk to each other.</br>
      (3) They talk about something besides a man. </br>
      The test was popularized by Alison Bechdel's comic published in 1985 <i>Dykes to Watch Out For </i>
    </span>

          The Bechdel test has become a commonly used tool for evaluating the representation of women in media. 
          It's used as a comparison with CMU movie data analysis.One thing to keep in mind is that the dataset can be biased, 
          since people need to know about the test first so that they can report if on movie pass the test. 
          It means these reporters were already aware the gender inequlaity in the movie industry so they might be biased on the choice of movies.
